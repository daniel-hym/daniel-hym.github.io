                                    <p>Hi! I'm Lola, a senior at Shanghai Pinghe School. I love math – it's granted me the freedom to temporarily reside in a world that feels less complex and chaotic. I've qualified for the USAMO, won team top 10 in ARML, and placed in multiple other math tournaments. Research-wise I'm interested in discrete mathematics, origami theory, and the idea of fractionalization in multiple disciplines. Outside of math, I enjoy solving witty puzzles, reading poetry, designing board games, and dancing – ballet has been my passion for twelve years. Last summer at the Ross Mathematics Program, I was truly inspired by its collaborative spirit, which reinforced my belief in the power of an engaging community. Through INTEGIRLS, I hope to share my love of math and help, following a similar vein, foster an inclusive, supportive community of female math enthusiasts.</p>

I love math – it's granted me the freedom to temporarily reside in a world that feels less complex and chaotic. I've qualified for the USAMO, won team top 10 in ARML, and placed in multiple other math tournaments. Research-wise I'm interested in discrete mathematics, origami theory, and the idea of fractionalization in multiple disciplines. Outside of math, I enjoy solving witty puzzles, reading poetry, designing board games, and dancing – ballet has been my passion for twelve years. Last summer at the Ross Mathematics Program, I was truly inspired by its collaborative spirit, which reinforced my belief in the power of an engaging community.  Through INTEGIRLS, I hope to share my love of math and help, following a similar vein, foster an inclusive, supportive community of female math enthusiasts. </p>
